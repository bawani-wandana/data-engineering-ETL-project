Data Engineering ETL Project: Top 10 Largest Banks by Market Capitalization
This project involves the development of an automated ETL pipeline to compile and process data on the top 10 largest banks in the world, ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. The pipeline extracts the latest market cap data, transforms it to include equivalent values in GBP, EUR, and INR using exchange rates provided in a CSV file, and loads the processed information into both a local CSV file and an SQL database.
